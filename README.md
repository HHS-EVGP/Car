**This is all of the code that is running on the PIT pi!**

Things to note:
1. There are two folders "CAR" and "ARDUINO". The Car folder holds all of the code that is running on the PI. All of the code in the Arduino foler is running on the arduino.
2. The arduino is taking in all of the analog data and sending it to the PI.

Any problems? _I probably don't know how to fix it_
